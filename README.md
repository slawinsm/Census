# Census
Repository for working with Census data.

This repository is meant to be a place where I demonstrate how I clean and wrangle data I have downloaded from the [Census](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). 
They do a good job of providing you with data that is already well organized, however, the variable names often need work. I will use this repository to keep track of all of all of my data and code. 

If you have a more nifty or efficient way you have cleaned Census data, let me know!
